## Title :
Affordability Analysis of Developed Countries

## Introduction :
Developed countries, characterized by a sustainable economy, sustained economic growth, security, high per capita income, and advanced technological infrastructure, are often perceived as ideal places to live and advance one's career for the future. However, the global surge in inflation has prompted individuals to seek information on which developed country, maintaining a reasonable cost of living, is the most financially accessible. This project aims to address the most affordable countries by analyzing various factors of cost of living, average monthly salary, and the unemployment rate, where these attributes contribute to the affordability of living in different developed nations.

## Project Objective :

### Objective 1
Find out the cost of living in the top 10 developed countries in the world based on four common factors: housing, food/groceries, education, and utilities. The top 10 countries selected for analysis are Australia, Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States. All these countries will be compared to Canada.

#### Sub-Objectives :
1. Housing: Compare the cost of 1-bedroom rented apartments and the cost of property for purchase combined with mortgage rates with Canada.
2. Food/Groceries: Compare the cost of regular meals at a restaurant and basic groceries (milk, bread, eggs, water) with Canada.
3. Education: Compare the cost required for international primary schools for a year with Canada.
4. Utilities: Compare the cost of basic utilities like electricity, heating, cooling, water, and garbage with Canada.

### Objective 2
Find out the average salary earned by an individual in the top 10 developed countries and compare it with Canada.

### Objective 3
Find out the unemployment rate in the top 10 developed countries and compare the result with Canada.

## Prime Objective
Our groupâ€™s main objective is to find out which developed country is more affordable in terms of cost of living, average salary, and unemployment rate compared with Canada.

## Expected Outcomes
1. Identify the most affordable developed country for an average individual to live in the year 2021.
2. Provide insights into the cost of living, average salary, and unemployment rates across different developed countries.

## Intended Audience
These visualizations are created for the general public, serving individuals seeking a better lifestyle with affordability. The visualizations provide information about:

- The best-developed country where necessities are more affordable.
- The best-developed country where the mean salary is competitive.
- The best-developed country where unemployment rates are exceptionally low.

## Challenges Encountered
- Dataset Acquisition: Finding appropriate datasets that closely align with our objectives was challenging.
- Formulating Objectives: Due to the vast size of the dataset, finalizing specific objectives to pursue was difficult.

## Dataset Description
For this project, we used two datasets from Kaggle.com:

1. Cost of Living Dataset: Contains cost of living expenses for almost every country with a total number of 58 variables.
2. Unemployment Dataset: Covers the unemployment rate for all countries from the year 1991-2021.

Before starting the analysis, both datasets were joined in Tableau using the common field "country."

## Tableau Dashboard

After creating all the charts for all objectives, the charts are gathered together into a dashboard to provide a holistic view, making it easier to analyze and derive conclusions.


## Conclusion
By analyzing the three objectives, we aim to determine which developed country is the most affordable in 2021. Our findings will help individuals make informed decisions about which country is the optimal choice for a better lifestyle.
